In this level you will see,
That you can make two monsters one.
Of course, the two will make a unique
Monster that will be tons of scary fun!

Just step on the switch, watch it go dark,
Then wait and see which monsters made who.
In case you wonder, the signs will say stuff like
"Ghost + Zap Wand = Shocking Horror" to make it easy for you!

So just have fun, and be very careful, 'cause beyond the village lays
A danger worse then the others, one that you will have to slay.
Have fun merging creatures, goblins, zombies and other stuff...
The merge feature rocks! Now I shall leave, I think I've said enough.
